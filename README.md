# Digit-Recognition-Via-Neural-Networks
A program to recognise handwritten digits in MNIST dataset using Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

This is a three-layer network, with the first layer containing 784 neurons, the second layer(hidden layer) 30 neurons,
and the third layer 10(output layer) neuron.

The biases and weights for the network are initialized randomly, using a Gaussian distribution with mean 0, and variance 1.
Note that the first layer is assumed to be an input layer and last as output layer.

It is recommend that you use GPU to run this application.
